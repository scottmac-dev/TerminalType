# TerminalType
A touch typing terminal game built in rust for practicing and improving typing speed.

Next Steps:
- Gamified features (Animations, new high score output)
- Custom config {round time, word sets?}
- No repeated words and more word diversity
- Dynamic loading of next line and account for longer word sets
